The new development is M201 is to address two goals: (1) The UN sustainability goals and (2) Bryant 2030's vision skill and learning goals, which can be found [here](gen_ed.pdf). 

We believe that having the student working on a statistical project will satisfy these new requirements so we suggest the instructors to incorporate to their syllabus a project. We suggest that project should count for at least 10% of the total grades.  

Another aspect of the development is the computational software used for the course.  To this end,  we are  encouraged to use Excel for as much as possible, if not all, the statistical computations of the course. 

## 1. What is a statistical project?

According to Amstats: *A statistical project is the process of answering a research question using statistical techniques and presenting the work in a written report.* [Link](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-statproject.pdf).  

Although the final products of a typical statistical project likely to contains a written part (a report or an article) and a presentation part (slides or poster), these are not required and the instructors should have the academic freedom to design their own project for their classes.  The data used for the project might be existing available datasets or might be collected by the students using surveys. 

This NSF Grant discusses the benefit of projects in introductory statistic courses and also give guideline on how to conduct a research: [Discovery Learning Projects in Introductory Statistics](http://faculty.ung.edu/DJSpence/NSF/materials.html)

## 2. Project Examples

To help you develop your own project, we list here a few examples.  If you have a research project to share, please let us know so that we can include it here.

## 5. Q&A

1.  Is it required to use Excel for the statistical analysis in the course?

    -   *We are encouraged to use more Excel on the Gen-ed Math classes. Using Excel in both M110 and M201 will help the student consistently learn and strengthen their Excel skills.*
