The new development is M201 is to address two goals: (1) The UN sustainability goals and (2) Bryant 2030's vision skill and learning goals, which can be found [here](gen_ed.pdf). We believe that having the student working on a statistical project will satisfy these new requirement.

This webpage contains examples and guideline on conducting a final project for Math 201.

## Some Examples

## Q&A

1.  Is it required to use Excel for the statistical analysis the course?

    -   *We are encouraged to use more Excel on the Gen-ed Math classes. Using Excel in both M110 and M201 will help the student consistently learn and strengthen their Excel skills.*
